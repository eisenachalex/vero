<h4>Discovery Meeting (60-90 minutes)</h4>  <p>During the Discovery Meeting, we look forward to learning

about your financial and life situation to determine how we can best serve you and help you 

work towards your long term retirement goals. We will explain how our firmâ€™s background and 

experience as well as our vision for the future suits your investment strategy. We will also give 

you an introductory presentation about how we will develop your customized investment portfolio. </p>

<h4>Investment Planning Meeting (60-90 minutes)</h4>
<p>In preparation for the Investment Planning Meeting meeting, we will analyze your current 

investment holdings and prepare a recommendation that aligns with your risk tolerance and

financial needs and goals. We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your current

financial plan. We will give you our recommended investment strategy, discuss the account fees, 

and outline a detailed action plan designed to meet your personal objectives.</p>

<h4>Commitment Meeting (60-90 minutes)</h4> <p>The Commitment Meeting is a chance for you to ask any

further questions about or clarify aspects of your personalized investment strategy. We will also 

finalize fees and discuss account transfers. Should both parties choose to move forward with the 

relationship, the necessary paperwork will be signed and investment holdings transferred into a 

comprehensive investment portfolio.</p>

<h4>45 Day Follow-Up Meeting (60 minutes)</h4>  <p>The Follow-Up Meeting will give you the chance to

discuss the positioning and progress of your portfolio with us as well as gain familiarity with 

investment statements and online access to your account(s).</p>
  
<h4>Progress Meeting (1-4 times per year)</h4>  <p>The Progress Meeting will give us the opportunity to

reflect upon and reevaluate your financial goals and needs as outlined in the initial Discovery 

Meeting. We will discuss any recommendations based on changes that may have arisen. We 

will plan for future contributions and distributions from your portfolio to strengthen our current 

strategy and make sure it is still suitable for your future objectives.</p>
